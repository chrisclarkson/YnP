The function of NK and CD8+ T cells was exhausted with the increased expression of \nNKG2A in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, in patients convalescing after therapy, the number of NK an\nd CD8+ T cells was restored with reduced expression of NKG2A. These results suggest that the functio\nnal exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes is associated with SRAS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 i\nnfection may break down antiviral immunity at an early stage.",
